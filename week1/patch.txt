We can redirect the output of diff command to a diff file wherein the changes made in one file is redirected to a different diff file. 

The contents of the diff file can be patched with the help of patch command. The patch takes a diff file and applies the changes of the diff file into the other file. The patch always doesnt succeed but in most cases it will.

For instance for redirecting the diff output of file1.txt and file2.txt into changes.diff we use the > symbol

commands:

touch changes.diff
diff file1.txt file2.txt > changes.diff will redirect the output of diff into changes.diff


** For aplying the diff into the file we use the patch command 
patch file1.txt changes.diff applies the changes in changes.diff into file1.txt

Why use diff and patch ? Its because diff and patch can be applied on directories. Suppose we have a directory where there are many files applying diff on the directory will tell us what file is to be placed in which directory resulting in easier applying of changes

** Suppose our colleauge has created a file called exec.c but it errors out. We fix the error (exec_fix.c) and send the diff file to our colleauge who then applies patch to fix the error

commands :

diff exec.c exec_fix.c > exec_diff.diff

on colleauge side:

To view changes :

vi exec_diff.diff

Apply changes :
patch exec.c exec_diff.diff
