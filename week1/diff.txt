** When we use the diff command it gives the difference between two files. If we 
have c it means change. If we have a it means add , If we have c it means change 
and if we have d it means delete the output 

eg: 2,3c2 means in left side file 2,3 lines have been changed and their equivalent change is in line 2 of the file to the right

2,3c2
< This is file1
< 
---
> this is file2

The < symbol means its the file to the left and > means its the file to the right

** We can use the command diff -s to make the output more verbose ( If the two files are the same then there is no output but with -s flag there will be out put that the two files are same
we can use the -u flag to give more context around the changes like for instance on using diff -u file1.txt file2.txt gives the output:

--- file1.txt	2023-12-14 11:10:25.676694700 +0530
+++ file2.txt	2023-12-14 11:10:42.367715900 +0530
@@ -1,3 +1,2 @@
 This is a file
-This is file1
-
+this is file2

As we can see adding the -u flag gives us the date and time of the change + sign indicates the line that was added while - sign indicates the line that was removed with one line above the modified lines giving us some context as to what was changed
